we have to make it a more user interactive site as we have a lot of competition

so iam writing few priorities which need to be done to make it a master piece

priorities-
1) we need to redisign the page some what like this copy this link and paste in google ->"http://ecom.creativecentral.in/shop?category=&search="
2)our app should be easy and user friendly without complexity (users should get easy access so we need to keep a design in that manner)
3) a)shopping b)repairing guys c)bookings - these are the three parts where we need to work a lot rediriting the pages, connections between each link,making tables and grids 
4) regarding our entrepreneurship cell we currently need to build a different registration page so that these people can enroll themselves and be resgistered to sell their products
5)login page for our clients so that they can register and do the payments get prime membership etc etc

Note-
the task is very big and everyone needs to contribute 

tharun and me-
so what i have decided is me and tharun will do the whole setup from designing and registering part(login pages )

anuj and akshay-
anuj and akshay you guys needs to work on the core that is linking the pages and all that is (refer 3 rd priority )
so the task for akshay and anug is collect images of prodcts and start forming pages 
(if need help refer amazone flipkart and see how their pages are,
both work in pair have a common idea and layout after preparing one page share 
with me and tharun so that we can finalize the layout dont worry about linking see to it that you guys make it a realistic page as
its a big e commerce site try adding varities with price tags below images) first u guys do the shopping part ,repairing and booking we all 4 will do it together as it is easy .
